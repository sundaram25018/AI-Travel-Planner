Prices fluctuate, so compare before booking.\n*   **Transportation:**  Walking is your friend!  Utilize the free trams when possible.  Avoid taxis unless absolutely necessary.\n*   **Food:** Avoid expensive restaurants.  Look for happy hour specials, inexpensive eateries, and consider buying snacks and drinks from a grocery store.\n*   **Gambling:** Set a strict budget and stick to it. Don't chase losses.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Pricing:** Prices are estimates and can vary significantly based on the time of year (especially during holidays and conventions).\n*   **Reservations:** Make hotel reservations in advance, especially if traveling during peak season.\n*   **Flexibility:** Be flexible with your itinerary.  If something doesn't appeal to you, don't be afraid to skip it.\n*   **Hydration:**  Las Vegas is in the desert. Drink plenty of water, especially if you're walking around outside.\n*   **Sun Protection:** Wear sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.\n\nI hope this detailed plan helps you have a fantastic and affordable trip to Las Vegas!\n"},
